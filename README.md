# herotest
Herotest provides a standardized testing service for hero NFTs that exist in the Defi Kingdoms (DFK) metaverse.

This is not official DFK code and does not claim to be, etc etc.

# Standardized Testing Sucks
The original effort that inspired this project focused on the leveling aspect of hero NFTs and their suitability
for various professions.[1] However it explicitly ignores two other key usages of hero NFTs: 1) their ability to
generate new hero NFTs and 2) their ability to perform combat actions (against other heros or NPCs).

It would be ineffective to generate one all-consuming score to evaluate three distinct areas of expertise. Therefore
three different scores are proposed here.

* Professionalism - how suitable is a hero at a given profession?
* Summoning - how suitable is a hero for creating maximally beneficial new heroes?
* Combat - how suitable is a hero at a particular combat expertise?

# Methodology
We seek to answer two specific questions at this point in time.

* How suitable is a hero *right now* for professions?
  1. Compare the hero's stats to that of the overall population.
  2. Evaluate the alignment of a hero's class, stats, and profession.
* How suitable is a hero *in the future* for combat?
  1. Level the hero to 100 and obtain a confidence interval for all stats.
  2. Compare the hero's stats to that of the overall future level 100 population.
  3. Evaluate the hero's stats against standard RP combat profiles.
