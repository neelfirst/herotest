# herotest
Herotest provides a standardized testing service for hero NFTs that exist in the Defi Kingdoms (DFK) metaverse.

This is not official DFK code and does not claim to be, etc etc.

# Standardized Testing Sucks
The original effort that inspired this project focused on the leveling aspect of hero NFTs and their suitability
for various professions.[1] However it explicitly ignores two other key usages of hero NFTs: 1) their ability to
generate new hero NFTs and 2) their ability to perform combat actions (against other heros or NPCs).

It would be ineffective to generate one all-consuming score to evaluate three distinct areas of expertise. Therefore
three different scores are proposed here.

1. Professionalism - how suitable is a hero at a given profession?
1.1 Mining
1.2 Gardening
1.3 Fishing
1.4 Foraging
2. Summoning - how suitable is a hero for creating maximally beneficial new heroes?
3. Combat - how suitable is a hero at a particular combat expertise?
1.1 Tank
1.2 Rogue
1.3 Mage
1.4 Support
